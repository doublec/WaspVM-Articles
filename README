This started as a collection of my blog articles about [Wasp Lisp](https://github.com/swdunlop/WaspVM) in PDF format. I ended up changing it to be reference documentation on the Wasp Lisp.

The documentation for the functions was originally produced by running the 'waspdoc' utility included with Wasp Lisp and I added the functions available via the C primitives by hand.

The source document is in [ASCIIDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) format and can be compiled to PDF using 'a2x':

    a2x -f pdf waspvm-articles.txt
